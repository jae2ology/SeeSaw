# SUPPOSED to be a tiktok application clone

but this was my first time really using sanity and nextjs for data fetching and shadcn for the styles, 
used to work but failed and i confused myself.. 
### but i enjoyed the journey!

## Features: 
#### Languages:
Typescript, JavaScript, & CSS
#### Extras:
Nextjs, Sanity, Shadcn, Radix-ui, React OAuth, React, Vitejs

#### Supposedly: 
was going to have a login feature to login through google, for you page would
update as you refresh the discover/explore page, and videos would generate based on the categories that are on the page.

## Overall:
i enjoyed the practice! hopefully will learn more as time passes and i learn more :)
